# bolius_staticdomain
Rewrites URLs to static resources to a different domain

1. Install extension
2. Add your static domain (like xxxxxxxx.cloudfront.net) and check the "Use this domain for static resources" box. Put the static domain in the bottom of the list, to make sure it will not be used for non-static requests.
3. Browse the frontend using Cloudfront
